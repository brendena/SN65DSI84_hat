# SN64DSI84_hat
This is a dev board for the pi 5 to take the DSI input and output LVDS.  To do this, the board uses the [SN64DSI84](SN65DSI84).  This chip should be able to output most types of pinout.  It has a 30 pin flat connector and a 2.0mm pitch header poinout to do to most all pinouts.  There's external inputs for power for the LCD and LED if it has them.
